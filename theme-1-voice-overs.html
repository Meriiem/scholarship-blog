            <p>I realized the true power of a voice when I was seven years old. I wasn't looking at the TV, but I heard a villain speak from the other room, and I instantly got chills. That is the magic of voice acting—it bypasses your eyes and hits you right in the gut.</p>

            <p>When making my top five, I didn't want to just list the famous ones. I wanted the performances that proved voice acting is an art form equal to screen acting. Here are five <a href="https://www.voicetalentonline.com/services/voice-over/" class="font-bold text-fun-blue hover:underline">voice over</a> legends that define the medium.</p>

            <div>
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-2">1. Robin Williams as the Genie (Aladdin)</h2>
                <p>It’s the obvious choice because it changed everything. Before Robin Williams, animated voices were often stiff. Williams turned it into jazz. His performance was manic, improvised, and bursting with pure energy. He proved a voice actor could be the biggest star in the movie.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-2">2. Jeremy Irons as Scar (The Lion King)</h2>
                <p>If Williams was manic energy, Jeremy Irons was pure, dripping sarcasm. His voice sounds like expensive velvet being dragged over gravel. He made being "bad" look unbelievably stylish. The way he delivered lines with such utter disdain made Scar terrified without ever having to shout.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-2">3. Ellen DeGeneres as Dory (Finding Nemo)</h2>
                <p>Forget the comedy for a second. Listen to the scene where she begs Marlin not to leave her. The heartbreak in her voice is so genuine it makes you forget you are looking at a CGI fish. She brought a level of raw vulnerability that grounded the entire movie in reality.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-2">4. Mark Hamill as The Joker (Batman: TAS)</h2>
                <p>Most know him as Luke Skywalker, but Hamill is the greatest Joker of all time. His laugh is an instrument—terrifying, hysterical, and totally unhinged. He uses his voice to snap from comedy to horror in a microsecond.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-2">5. H. Jon Benjamin as Bob Belcher (Bob’s Burgers)</h2>
                <p>On the opposite end of the spectrum is the art of the "deadpan." H. Jon Benjamin sounds so incredibly tired and normal that it becomes hilarious. It’s the most realistic portrayal of a modern father I’ve ever heard.</p>
